Problem Statement: 
The Hospital Management System (HMS) project aims to address the challenges and inefficiencies in traditional hospital management processes. The key problems include manual record-keeping, accessing patient information, inefficient appointment, and lack of a centralized system for managing hospital operations and many more . 



METHODOLOGY (Tools and Technologies Used) : 

In our project, Python served as the cornerstone of our programming language, providing a robust and versatile foundation. Leveraging the power of TKINTER, a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) module, we crafted an intuitive and visually appealing interface. Complementing this, we seamlessly integrated small yet impactful libraries like message box, datetime, random and others, enhancing the project's functionality with efficiency and precision. Together, these components contributed to a seamless and effective development experience. 
TKINTER provides a set of tools to create windows, frames, buttons, and other GUI elements, simplifying the development of interactive applications. It’s versatility and simplicity make it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced developers when building desktop applications in Python.
